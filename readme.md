# AI Agents for Blockchain Tracking and Rewards System

This project integrates **AI agents** to monitor, track, and engage users across multiple blockchain networks. It allows for decentralized reward distribution, transaction tracking, content moderation, and cross-chain interactions. By using smart contracts, AI agents can automate user activities and enhance decentralized applications (DApps). This project enables a robust user engagement and reward system across ecosystems like **Solana**, **Ethereum**, **Aptos**, **Avalanche**, and **Sui**.

The project is designed to be scalable, utilizing various blockchain protocols, smart contracts, and real-time data processing to offer enhanced user experiences and reward systems for decentralized applications.

### 1. Blockchain API Keys
The project requires API keys for interaction with different blockchain networks. Please obtain the required keys from the respective providers.

- **Solana**: Create a wallet and get the API key from Solana's network.
- **Aptos**: Obtain your API key from the Aptos network.
- **Ethereum**: Use Infura or Alchemy to get an Ethereum API key.
- **Sui**: Get the API key for the Sui blockchain.

### 2. Set API Keys in `config.py`

Add the obtained API keys to the `config.py` file:

```python
SOLANA_API_KEY = "your_solana_api_key"
APTOS_API_KEY = "your_aptos_api_key"
ETHEREUM_API_KEY = "your_ethereum_api_key"
SUI_API_KEY = "your_sui_api_key"
```

### 3. Set Up Blockchain Networks
Configure the blockchain networks you wish to interact with in the `config.py` file:

```python
BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORKS = ["Solana", "Ethereum", "Aptos", "Avalanche", "Sui"]
```

### 4. Smart Contract Configuration
Add the addresses for the deployed smart contracts and configure reward parameters:

```python
SMART_CONTRACTS = {
    "solana": "your_solana_contract_address",
    "ethereum": "your_ethereum_contract_address",
    "aptos": "your_aptos_contract_address",
    "avalanche": "your_avalanche_contract_address",
    "sui": "your_sui_contract_address"
}

REWARD_SYSTEM = {
    "transaction_rewards": 10,
    "staking_rewards": 20,
    "activity_rewards": 5
}
```

## Key Functionalities

### 1. **Blockchain RPC Methods**
Each blockchain interaction, whether itâ€™s to fetch transaction details, track balances, or query smart contracts, is handled using blockchain-specific RPC methods.

#### Example - Solana RPC:
```python
from solana.rpc.api import Client

solana_client = Client("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com")
transaction = solana_client.get_transaction(transaction_signature)
```

#### Example - Ethereum RPC using Web3.py:
```python
from web3 import Web3

w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID'))
transaction = w3.eth.getTransaction(transaction_hash)
```

---

### 2. **AI-Powered User Interaction**
The **AI chatbot** is integrated using Google Generative AI (Gemini), which enables personalized user interaction, content moderation, and reward query handling.

#### Example - AI Content Moderation and Chatbot:
```python
import google.generativeai as genai

genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash")

def get_ai_response(query):
    response = model.generate_content(query)
    return response.text
```

### 3. **Twitter Integration**
The project includes integration with the Twitter API to track user engagement and facilitate airdrop participation through social media interactions.

#### Example - Fetching Tweets:
```python
import tweepy

client = tweepy.Client(bearer_token='your_bearer_token')

tweets = client.search_recent_tweets(query='#AI', max_results=10)
```

### 4. **Cross-Chain Rewards Distribution**
Rewards are distributed based on user activity across different blockchain networks. The AI agents monitor activity on each chain and trigger rewards when certain conditions are met.

#### Example - Reward Distribution on Ethereum:
```python
from web3 import Web3

def distribute_rewards(user_address, amount):
    contract = w3.eth.contract(address=SMART_CONTRACTS['ethereum'], abi=contract_abi)
    tx = contract.functions.distributeRewards(user_address, amount).transact({'from': admin_address})
    return tx
```

## Usage

### Running the AI Agent

Start the AI agent to begin tracking user activities and rewarding them on multiple blockchains:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Engaging with the AI Chatbot

Users can interact with the AI chatbot by querying about their rewards, transaction statuses, and blockchain activities. The chatbot leverages the Google Gemini AI to respond intelligently to user queries.

### Cross-Chain Data Sync and Reward Distribution

The AI agents monitor activities across Solana, Ethereum, Aptos, and other chains. Based on the user's engagement, rewards are distributed via smart contracts on each blockchain.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Initial integration with Solana, Ethereum, and Aptos blockchains.
- **Phase 2**: Expand to more blockchains (e.g., Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Sui).
- **Phase 3**: Enhance AI capabilities to personalize rewards and user interactions.
- **Phase 4**: Cross-chain data synchronization and airdrop automation via social media platforms.
